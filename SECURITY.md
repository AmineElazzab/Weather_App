This policy outlines the measures we take to protect the security of your data.

## Data Collection and Use

We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our services.

We use industry-standard security measures to protect the data we collect. 
This includes encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest, 
as well as secure server infrastructure with restricted access.


## Incident Response

In the event of a security breach, we will take prompt action to investigate and contain the incident.
We will also notify affected users as soon as possible and provide them with information on the steps they
can take to protect their data.


## Continuous Monitoring

We continuously monitor our systems and services to detect and prevent security incidents. 
We also regularly review and update our security measures to stay up-to-date with industry best practices.
